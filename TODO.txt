----------

For code generator I would like to use 
2 initial files,

1st one is describing the connection of controller to the PCB.
This file will be written once.

The second file will describe the connections of external perifireal to
main extension board.


For the beggining I have to deskribe the highest level.


MEB (Main extension board level)

	J1
	{
		SCL_EXT -- 1    #Clock on I2C bus
		SDA_EXT -- 5	#I/O, The communication busses should be defined separately

# packet communication.

}

# Common flow of actions.
